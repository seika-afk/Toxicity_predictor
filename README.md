## 📄 Overview

This project uses a dataset of Reddit relationship posts to predict the type or tone of a text input. It leverages classical NLP methods (TF-IDF, stemming, stopword removal) along with scikit-learn classifiers such as:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVC)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

---

## 🧪 Features

- Text cleaning using regular expressions
- Lowercasing, stopword removal, and stemming
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Multi-class classification
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, and recall
